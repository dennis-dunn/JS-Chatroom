## Steps:
1. Make sure that [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is installed
2. To start the backend server, in a command console run:
~~~
node mainServer.js
~~~
3. Open `client.html` in the browser (2 or more instances on any machine).
4. The server will run on the default port 8080, but enter the IP address with this port number after a colon `:`
	then choose a UserName and click `Connect` for all of the clients.
5. Type a message into the textbox and press `Send` to distribute it among all connected clients.
